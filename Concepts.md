# Concepts list. 

Listed Below are the new concepts that I learned while completing the Assignments on www.swapnil-ingle.github.io

## Internal Working of seek:

### Syntax: fileObject.seek(offset,Whence)

The seek in python is similar to fseek in stdio.h. It is used to manupulate the current file pointer by the passed offset.
The default value of offset is 0. 

Whereas passing 1 as argument loads the fpointer to start of the file and passing 2 load it to the end of the file.
